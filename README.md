# Hallucinated Reference Detector

A tool to detect potentially hallucinated or fabricated references in academic PDF papers. It extracts references from PDFs and validates them against academic databases (CrossRef, arXiv, DBLP, OpenReview, Semantic Scholar, and optionally OpenAlex). Available as both a command-line tool and a web interface.

Created by Gianluca Stringhini with the help of Claude Code and ChatGPT

## Features

- Pure Python PDF reference extraction using PyMuPDF (no external services required)
- Supports multiple citation formats:
  - IEEE (quoted titles)
  - ACM (year before title)
  - USENIX (author-title-venue format)
  - AAAI/ACM author-year format
- Validates references against multiple academic databases:
  - OpenAlex (optional, with API key)
  - CrossRef
  - arXiv
  - DBLP
  - OpenReview
  - Semantic Scholar (aggregates Academia.edu, SSRN, PubMed, and more)
  - ACL Anthology
  - NeurIPS
- **Fast concurrent processing**:
  - 4 references checked in parallel
  - All 8 databases queried simultaneously per reference
  - Early exit when match found
  - Configurable timeouts via `DB_TIMEOUT` env var
- **Real-time progress streaming** in web interface via Server-Sent Events
- **Automatic retry** for failed/timed out database queries
- Author matching to detect title matches with wrong authors
- Colored terminal output for easy identification of issues
- Handles em-dash citations (same authors as previous reference)
- Web interface for easy PDF upload and analysis
- **Archive support** - Upload ZIP or tar.gz files with multiple PDFs
- Clickable source links to verified papers (DOI, arXiv, etc.)
- Google Scholar links for manual verification of flagged references

## Installation

### pip

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Docker

Run the web interface in a container:

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t hallucinator .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5001:5001 hallucinator
```

Then open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser.

To enable debug mode:

```bash
docker run -p 5001:5001 -e FLASK_DEBUG=1 hallucinator
```



## Usage

```bash
# Basic usage
python check_hallucinated_references.py <path_to_pdf>

# Without colored output (for piping or non-color terminals)
python check_hallucinated_references.py --no-color <path_to_pdf>

# Save output to file
python check_hallucinated_references.py --output log.txt <path_to_pdf>

# Use OpenAlex API for improved coverage
python check_hallucinated_references.py --openalex-key=YOUR_API_KEY <path_to_pdf>

# Combine options
python check_hallucinated_references.py --no-color --output results.txt --openalex-key=KEY <path_to_pdf>
```

### Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--no-color` | Disable colored output (useful for piping or logging) |
| `--output=FILE` | Save output to a file |
| `--openalex-key=KEY` | OpenAlex API key for improved coverage. Get a free key at https://openalex.org/settings/api |

## Web Interface

The tool also includes a web interface for easier use.

### Starting the Web Server

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Start the Flask server
python app.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:5001`.

### Using the Web Interface

1. Open `http://localhost:5001` in your browser
2. Upload a PDF file or archive (ZIP/tar.gz with multiple PDFs)
3. (Optional) Enter your OpenAlex API key for improved coverage
4. Click "Analyze References"
5. Watch real-time progress:
   - Progress bar and current reference being checked
   - Live results streaming in as each reference is verified
   - Retry pass for any timed-out queries
6. View final results showing:
   - Summary statistics (verified, author mismatches, not found)
   - Timeout warnings showing which databases failed
   - List of potentially hallucinated references with Google Scholar links
   - Per-reference timeout info (which DBs timed out for each "not found" reference)
   - Collapsible list of verified references with clickable source links

The web interface uses Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time streaming progress, so you can watch each reference being checked rather than waiting for the entire analysis to complete.



## Example Output

```
Analyzing paper example.pdf

============================================================
POTENTIAL HALLUCINATION DETECTED
============================================================

Title:
  Some Fabricated Paper Title That Does Not Exist

Status: Reference not found in any database
Searched: CrossRef, arXiv, DBLP, OpenReview, Semantic Scholar

------------------------------------------------------------

============================================================
SUMMARY
============================================================
  Total references analyzed: 35
  Verified: 34
  Not found (potential hallucinations): 1
```

## How It Works

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PyMuPDF to extract text from the PDF
2. **Reference Section Detection**: Locates the "References" or "Bibliography" section
3. **Reference Segmentation**: Splits references by numbered patterns ([1], [2], etc.)
4. **Title & Author Extraction**: Parses each reference to extract title and authors
5. **Concurrent Database Validation**:
   - Checks 4 references in parallel
   - For each reference, queries all 8 databases simultaneously
   - Returns immediately when a verified match is found (early exit)
   - Databases: OpenAlex, CrossRef, arXiv, DBLP, OpenReview, Semantic Scholar, ACL Anthology, NeurIPS
6. **Author Matching**: Confirms that found titles have matching authors
7. **Retry Pass**: References marked "not found" due to timeouts are retried at the end

## Skipped References

Some references are skipped during analysis and not checked against databases. The tool reports how many references were skipped and why:

- **Non-academic URLs**: References pointing to websites, GitHub repositories, documentation pages, or other non-academic sources are skipped. These cannot be verified in academic databases. URLs to academic publishers (ACM, IEEE, USENIX, arXiv, DOI) are still processed.

- **Short titles**: References with titles shorter than 5 words are skipped. Very short titles are often not academic papers (e.g., software names, dataset titles) and are prone to false matches.

## Title-Only Verification

References where author names could not be extracted are still checked against databases, but only by title. These are reported as "title-only" in the summary. If the title is found in a database, it counts as verified (without author confirmation).

## Limitations

- References to non-indexed sources (technical reports, websites, books) may be flagged as "not found"
- Very recent papers may not yet be indexed in databases
- Some legitimate papers in niche journals may not be found
- PDF extraction quality depends on the PDF structure

## Dependencies

- `requests` - HTTP requests for API queries
- `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
- `rapidfuzz` - Fuzzy string matching for title comparison
- `feedparser` - arXiv API response parsing
- `PyMuPDF` - PDF text extraction
- `flask` - Web interface
